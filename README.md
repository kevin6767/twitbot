Twitter bot for sending tweets

UPDATE 10/3
Creating a twitter bot using Node.js and a couple of libaries. Currently the 1.0 version only favorites tweets. But soon I want it to be able to
direct message people and engage in full on conversations using a database of responses. 

10/7 

Bot now replies and sends tweets out. I have added a small array of responses for each of them.
